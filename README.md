# üß† AI Workflow Adviser / Optimiser Scenarios

This repository includes real-world GitHub Actions workflow examples created for **AI Awareness Week**. Each workflow simulates a distinct pattern or issue commonly found in CI/CD pipelines, and is linked with representative **AI prompts** for training or querying a Workflow Optimiser or Adviser.
